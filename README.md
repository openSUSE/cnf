# **Command not found handler for openSUSE**

1.  A replacement for a [python based `command-not-found` handler](https://github.com/openSUSE/scout/blob/master/handlers/bin/command-not-found) for openSUSE.
2.  Written in Rust, so has as few runtime dependencies as is possible.
3.  Uses [`libsolv`](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv) under the hood, so is 100% compatible with `zypper`.

## **Build**

```.sh
cargo build
```

## **Direct usage**

To query not installed programs:

```.sh
./target/debug/cnf cmake
```
> ```.log
> The program 'cmake' can be found in following packages:
>   * cmake-full [ path: /usr/bin/cmake, repository: repo-oss ]
>   * cmake-mini [ path: /usr/bin/cmake, repository: repo-oss ]
> 
> Try installing with:
>     sudo zypper install <selected_package>
> ```

To query installed programs in `/usr/sbin`:

```.sh
./target/debug/cnf chcpu
```
> ```.log
> Absolute path to 'chcpu' is '/usr/sbin/chcpu', so running it may require superuser privileges (eg. root).
> ```

To query installed programs in `/usr/bin`:

```.sh
./target/debug/cnf vim
```
> ```.log
> Absolute path to 'vim' is '/usr/bin/vim'. Please check your $PATH variable to see whether it contains the mentioned path
> ```

##  **Integrate with `bash`**

```.sh
source command_not_found_bash
export COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_BIN=./target/debug/cnf
cmake
```
> ```.log
> The program 'cmake' can be found in following packages:
>   * cmake-full [ path: /usr/bin/cmake, repository: repo-oss ]
>   * cmake-mini [ path: /usr/bin/cmake, repository: repo-oss ]
> 
> Try installing with:
>     sudo zypper install <selected_package>
> ```

## **Integration tests**

Integration tests runs inside docker image tagged `local/cnf-ci`. It is built as a part of Github Action and can be built locally as `cd test; docker build -t local/cnf-ci:latest .`

The testing itself is wrapped in [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and in order to make it run, one needs to initialize the git submodules (`git submodule init`). Then tests can be executed using a following command

```.sh
./test/bats/bin/bats ./test/
```
> ```.log
> test.bats
>  ✓ root: installed /usr/bin/rpm
> >  ✓ root: installed /usr/sbin/sysctl
>  ✓ root: not installed xnake
>  ✓ root: not installed make
>  ✓ root: not installed cmake
>  ✓ nonroot: not installed cmake
>  ✓ nonroot: bash without handler: not installed cmake
>  ✓ nonroot: bash handler: not installed cmake
>  ✓ nonroot: zsh without handler: not installed cmake
>  ✓ nonroot: zsh handler: not installed cmake
>  ✓ nonroot: fish handler: not installed cmake
>  ✓ issue26: do not list not installable files
>
> 12 tests, 0 failures
> ```

Every test can be executed on a command line. The `root.sh` wrapper mounts the
binary to `/usr/bin/cnf` and bash/fish integrations.

```.sh
./root.sh /usr/bin/cnf rpm
```
> ```.log
> Absolute path to 'rpm' is '/usr/bin/rpm'. Please check your $PATH variable to see whether it contains the mentioned path
> ```

## **PowerShell users**

As `cnf` does not integrate with PowerShell by default, please read the issue
comment https://github.com/openSUSE/cnf/issues/8#issuecomment-1854638267 to
learn how to configure your system properly:

Here's an example `command_not_found.ps1` file that somewhat emulates what `command_not_found.bash` does:

```.PS1
#!/usr/bin/env -S pwsh

#Requires -PSEdition Core
#Requires -Version 7

$Env:TEXTDOMAINDIR = '/usr/share/locale'
$Env:TEXTDOMAIN = 'cnf'

$ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.CommandNotFoundAction = {

    param($commandAsSubmitted, $commandLookupEventArgs)

    # Ignore the following invocations via:
    # *   A 'get-*' prefix stemming from PowerShell's default-verb logic;
    # *   A repeated lookup in the *current* dir. (./…) - PowerShell itself will provide feedback on that; and
    # *   Calls from scripts.
    if ($commandAsSubmitted -like 'Get-*' -or $commandAsSubmitted -like '.[/\]*' -or (Get-PSCallStack)[1].ScriptName) { return }

    # Determine the executable path.
    $cnf_bin = $env:COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_BIN ?? '/usr/bin/cnf'

    # Invoke and output the results directly to the terminal (host).
    & $cnf_bin $commandAsSubmitted *>&1 | Out-Host

    # Note:
    # *   PowerShell's not-found error is seemingly invariably printed afterwards; the following does *NOT* prevent that:
    #     ```.PS1
    #     $commandLookupEventArgs.StopSearch = $true
    #     ```
    # *   Supposedly, returning a `[System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo]` instance - such as output by `Get-Command` - can provide the command to execute, but that doesn't seem to work.

}
```

*   This script can be invoked directly (doesn't need sourcing); e.g.. `./command_not_found.ps1`
*   A call to this script (or the code it contains) is best placed in the user's [`$PROFILE`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Profiles) file.
*   As in the Bash case, the mechanism supports only _one_ custom command-not-found handler.
    *   However, a plug-in system is being worked on that supports multiple third-party handlers, called _feedback providers_ - see [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/what-are-feedback-providers/).
    *   Someone could write a custom feedback provider that incorporates `cnf`, similar to the one in the [`command-not-found` provider](https://github.com/PowerShell/command-not-found); the latter currently relies solely on the presence of `/usr/lib/command-not-found`, as preinstalled on Ubuntu distros.
